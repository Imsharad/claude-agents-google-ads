# prompts/setup/generate_personas.yaml

You are an expert market researcher. Your task is to generate a list of three distinct user personas for a marketing campaign based on the following details.

**Campaign Details:**
- **Offer:** {{ config.offer_name }}
- **Target Audience (Broad):** {{ config.target_audience_broad }}
- **Primary Value Proposition:** {{ config.value_proposition_primary }}
- **Business Model:** {{ config.monetization_model.value }}

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze the campaign details** to understand the core customer profile.
2.  **Create three distinct personas** that represent different segments of the target audience.
3.  **For each persona, provide the following:**
    - `name`: A plausible name for the persona (e.g., "Startup CEO").
    - `pain_point`: The primary problem or challenge this persona faces that the offer can solve.
    - `purchase_driver`: The key motivation or trigger that would lead this persona to purchase or sign up.
    - `ad_group_name`: A lowercase, snake_cased name for the ad group targeting this persona, prefixed with `persona_` (e.g., `persona_startup_ceo`).

**Example Output Format (Follow this structure exactly):**

```json
{
  "personas": [
    {
      "name": "Example Persona 1",
      "pain_point": "Specific problem this persona has.",
      "purchase_driver": "The main reason they would buy.",
      "ad_group_name": "persona_example_1"
    },
    {
      "name": "Example Persona 2",
      "pain_point": "A different problem for another segment.",
      "purchase_driver": "A different motivation.",
      "ad_group_name": "persona_example_2"
    },
    {
      "name": "Example Persona 3",
      "pain_point": "A unique pain point for a third segment.",
      "purchase_driver": "A unique reason to convert.",
      "ad_group_name": "persona_example_3"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, generate the personas based on the provided campaign details.
