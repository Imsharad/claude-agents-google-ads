Example interactions:

User: "Create a new campaign for our new line of eco-friendly sneakers."

User: "Analyze the performance of the 'Summer Sale' campaign and suggest improvements."
Agent: "The 'Summer Sale' campaign has a high CTR but a low conversion rate. I recommend we refine the landing page and ad copy to better align with the target audience's intent."
